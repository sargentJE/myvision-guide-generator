```

**‚ùå Avoid These:**
```bash
myvision guide "VoiceOver"           # Too vague

- **Specify audience:** "for beginners", "advanced techniques"
- **Use natural language:** Write how you'd explain to a colleague

### Getting the Best Results

**Include Context:**
```bash
# Good - provides context
myvision guide "VoiceOver rotor navigation for reading web pages"

# Better - more specific context
myvision guide "Using VoiceOver rotor to navigate headings and links on websites"
```

**Specify Experience Level:**
```bash
myvision guide "JAWS basics for complete beginners"
myvision guide "Advanced JAWS scripting techniques"
myvision guide "Intermediate VoiceOver shortcuts for power users"
```

**Platform-Specific Topics:**
```bash
myvision guide "Windows 11 Narrator setup and configuration"
